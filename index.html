                    <p class="this_year">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how Icould improve my design skills and attract more customers. I wantedto start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only onpaper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for somechallenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. Isaw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily userinterface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that theresult was just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
